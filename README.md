Increasing the Efficiency of a given Rankine Cycle

## Rankine Cycle
The Rankine Cycle depicts the operation of steam power plants. It comprises of four stages: Compression, Heat Addition, Expansion and Heat Rejection. It illustrates the transformation of water into steam to generate power.

The cycle begins with water compression followed by head addition isothermally inside a boiler. Then expansion takes place inside the turbine and then the process concludes by isobaric heat rejection in a condenser.

Rankine cycle provides fundamental insights into the efficiency of steam-based power systems, guiding the analysis and optimization of practical applications.

## Processes Used to increase the efficiency
1. Reheating
2. Regeneration

We gradually increased the efficiency step by step.
1. One Reheater
2. One Reheater + One Regenerator
3. One Reheater + Two Regenerators
4. Two Reheaters + One Regenerator
5. Two Reheaters + Two Regenerators

Following the steps, we observed that there was gradual increase in the efficiency.
